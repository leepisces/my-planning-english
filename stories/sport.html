        Last summer, I went on a
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="trip">trip</span> with my best
        friend, Leo 🌞. We both love
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="sport">sport</span>, so we
        decided to visit a town famous for its international sports
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="festival">festival</span>.
        <br /><br />
        On the first day, we watched
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="athletics"
          >athletics</span
        >
        at the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="stadium">stadium</span>.
        It was so exciting to see each
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="athlete">athlete</span>
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="run">run</span>,
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="jump">jump</span>, and
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="throw">throw</span> with
        so much energy! 🏃‍♂️💨 <br /><br />
        Next, we went to the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="motor racing"
          >motor racing</span
        >
        event. The noise was crazy! Every
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="racing driver"
          >racing driver</span
        >
        tried their best to
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="drive">drive</span> fast
        and <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="race">race</span> to
        the finish line. Leo said he wanted to become a racing driver someday!
        🏎️💥 <br /><br />
        In the evening, we relaxed by the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="pool">pool</span> and
        watched the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="swimming">swimming</span>
        contest. One
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="swimmer">swimmer</span>
        finished first and smiled as he got his gold
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="medal">medal</span>. 🏊‍♀️🥇
        <br /><br />
        The next morning, we saw an
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="intense">intense</span>
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="boxing">boxing</span>
        match in the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="boxing ring"
          >boxing ring</span
        >. The
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="boxer">boxers</span>
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="fight">fought</span>
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="bravely">bravely</span>, but one
        finally won with a powerful
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="punch">punch</span>. 🥊😮
        <br /><br />
        Later that day, we traveled to the mountains for some
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="skiing">skiing</span>. I
        had never tried skiing before, but the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="ski slopes"
          >ski slopes</span
        >
        were amazing! I watched a professional
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="skier">skier</span> show
        off his skills. ⛷️❄️ <br /><br />
        In the afternoon, we cheered loudly at a
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="football">football</span>
        game on the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="pitch">pitch</span>. The
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="footballer"
          >footballers</span
        >
        were fast and clever. ⚽🔥 <br /><br />
        That evening, we went to an
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="ice hockey"
          >ice hockey</span
        >
        match. The
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="ice hockey rink"
          >ice hockey rink</span
        >
        was <span class="vocab-word" data-word="freezing">freezing</span>, but
        the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="ice hockey player"
          >ice hockey players</span
        >
        didn't mind. They played hard and made us
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="shout">shout</span> in excitement!
        🏒⛸️ <br /><br />
        The next day, we visited a green
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="golf course"
          >golf course</span
        >, where some
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="golfer">golfers</span>
        played calmly and seriously. Leo tried to
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="play">play</span> too, but
        hit the ball into a
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="tree">tree</span>! 😂🏌️ <br /><br />
        After lunch, we walked to the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="basketball court"
          >basketball court</span
        >. The tall
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="basketball player"
          >basketball players</span
        >
        jumped and scored many points. It was fast and fun! 🏀⛹️ <br /><br />
        In the late afternoon, we went
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="sailing">sailing</span> on
        a beautiful
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="lake">lake</span>, and
        then on the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="sea">sea</span>. The
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="wind">wind</span> was strong, but
        the
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="sailor">sailors</span>
        knew how to
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="sail">sail</span> safely.
        ⛵🌊 <br /><br />
        It was the best sports weekend of our lives. We saw every type of
        <span class="vocab-word bold-word" data-word="person">person</span>
        doing their best. We
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="cheer">cheered</span>, learned, and
        even tried new sports ourselves! What an
        <span class="vocab-word" data-word="unforgettable">unforgettable</span>
